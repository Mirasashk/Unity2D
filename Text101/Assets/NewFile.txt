First couple lines of text.
Oohhh Nooo, I am lost, what am I going to do. I need to find my way back but I
don't remember how I got here, hmmm... 

Let see, I can go to that park on the left and maybe someone can help me find
my way, or I can follow this trail and maybe I can find something that can help
me identify where I am.

First couple choices
What should I do?

1: Go to park
2: Follow trail
